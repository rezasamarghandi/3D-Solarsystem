# 3D-Solarsystem
3D Solar system simulation

This code is a simulation of gravitational perturbations, which models the interaction between celestial bodies in space. It calculates the acceleration of a body in response to the gravitational pull of other bodies using the gravitational constant, G. The simulation defines a Body class, which specifies a body's name, mass, velocity, and position, and includes a method to calculate gravitational perturbations. The update_info function prints information about the position and velocity of each body in the simulation. 



Please note that planets constants may be incorrect or incomplete and initial positions and velocities aren't exact values.
